# Nutshell
The project focused on creating processes to address the issues faced by private tutors. This included creating Python programmes that allowed tutors to: 

- Easily record a walkthrough of a question, provide a few parameters then let the program generate a series of videos to upload to Instagram and YouTube
- Scrape free online resources by entering a few keywords then having the program create a refined task sheet for students
